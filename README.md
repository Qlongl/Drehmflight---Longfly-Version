# Drehmflight---Longfly-Version
This is a slightly modified version of Nick Rehm's dRehmflight designed to work with the Longfly Projects

So note: Almost all of this code was written by Nick Rehm, this code simply serves as a fork of Nick Rehm's dRehmflight code 
that will work with less setup for Longfly projects.
