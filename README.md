# Drehmflight---Longfly-Version
This is a slightly modified version of Nick Rehm's dRehmflight designed to work with the Longfly Projects

So note: Almost all of this code was written by Nick Rehm, this code simply serves as a fork of Nick Rehm's dRehmflight code 
that will work with less setup for Longfly projects. 

Only the 3d print file for the "PID-Demo" and "PID-Tuning Stand" can be found amoung the attatched files, the Longfly VTOL & Quadrocopter files must be purchased from Longfly.shop. 

Please message me (Quin Long, founder of Longfly) at +1 617-992-8071 if you need any assistance with anything
